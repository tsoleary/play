Here you can set the global stuff for the whole thing
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Second Largest Header
### Third Largest Header
#### Fourth Largest Header

## Fancy formatting below

```{r}
2 + 2
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

gapminder <- read.csv("/Users/tsoleary/R/play/r_lessons/gapminder_data.csv")

ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,color = continent)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```

echo = FALSE -- not display code  
eval = FALSE -- code won't run, ignore chunk entirely  
warnings = FALSE -- not display warning  
cache = TRUE -- if something is  
fig.width =  
fig.height =  
fig cap = -- caption  

```{r}
x <- 7 * 3
```

This cool chunk is called an inline code so you can just put it out the 
specific number `r x` in text itself

There are a few packages out there to help pit out nicely formatted tables:  
stargazers  
xtable  
kable

## R Markdown


Get the R MArkdown Cheatsheet too

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R 
Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes 
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the 
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent 
printing of the R code that generated the plot.
